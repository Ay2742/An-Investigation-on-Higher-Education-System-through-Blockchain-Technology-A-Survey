# An-Investigation-on-Higher-Education-System-through-Blockchain-Technology-A-Survey
Data is divided into blocks using the Blockchain 
technology, and each block is protected using a different 
cryptographic technique to maintain privacy and security. A chain 
is formed by the blocksâ€™ mesh topological connections to one 
another. The use of blockchain is beginning across a variety of 
industries, including banking, the government, the military, and 
education. In this study, we wish to examine how blockchain 
technology has impacted colleges in terms of information and 
technology in order to raise the standard of universities. 
Reviewing earlier research publications that are relevant to the 
study is the process utilized. As a result, it is anticipated that this 
research will make a positive impact by helping to solve issues 
with blockchain implementation in higher education, namely how 
to utilize the system, what blockchain is, and how to transform 
disruptive technology into current technology.
